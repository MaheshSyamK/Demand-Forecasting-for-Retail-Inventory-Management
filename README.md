Demand Forecasting for Retail Inventory Management 

Project Overview
  This project focuses on predicting retail demand for efficient inventory management using both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches. 
  The goal is to optimize stock levels, reduce costs, and meet customer demand effectively.

Features
  Data Preprocessing        : Handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
  Exploratory Data Analysis : Visualizing trends, seasonality, and correlations.
  Classical ML Models       : Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  Deep Learning Models      : Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for complex relationships.
  Hyperparameter Tuning     : Optimizing model parameters using GridSearchCV.
  Deployment                : Save and load trained models for real-world predictions.

Dataset
  The dataset includes features like category, region, inventory levels, units sold, pricing, promotions, competitor pricing, weather, and seasonality.

Tools and Technologies
  Programming Language : Python
  Libraries  	         : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
